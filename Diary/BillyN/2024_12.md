The issues I was having around using a LegacyDataPlatform are because originally, I'd thought of DataPlatform as something configured globally and then selected for use by the ecosystem broker when the Workspaces are used to create the various pipeline graphs for each DataPlatform. The idea here was there would be a US AWS DataPlatform possibily using specify S3 buckets and Glue instances. There would also be others. The cardinality between DataPlatform instance and Workspaces would be 1:N. Many Workspaces per DataPlatform instance. However, with legacy data pipelines, this cardinality changes. It becomes 1:1. The problem was then that currently, DataPlatforms instances are declared at the ecosystem level. The Workspaces are decoupled from the DataPlatforms using a PlatformChooser. I used the Fixed platform chooser to create a legacy dataplatform instance configured with the team which owns the pipeline and other metadata for governance such as the DataContainers used by that legacy DataPlatform. This creates a problem in that this legacy platform is basically directly coupled to the Workspace which it actually is. It's possible that the legacy platform is used by multiple Workspaces, indeed this is likely. So, it's not quite 1:1, it's still 1:N but likely small N.

But, the impact of the original design is that ALL these legacy platforms would need to be created at the Ecosystem level and approved by the ecosystem team before those Workspaces were created and then referenced the legacy DataPlatform likely using a lookup platform method on Ecosystem with a key. This keeps the definition of the legacy platform centralized and it's referenced by the Workspace. The friction this causes might be an issue. But, at the same time, the Workspace team would create a lone of the repo, create the legacy platform in the Ecosystem, do a pull request, the eco team approves it and then the Workspace team can reference it when creating the Workspace. This is not bad. This allows the eco team to police the creation of duplicate platforms for example (in an ideal world, of course). It also exposes the Workspace team to seeing the other platforms and hopefully reusing an existing one, possibly adding some data containers used by this specific Workspace to it. This isn't that bad.

So, maybe the original design is still good. Working through this flow shows it's not that bad.
