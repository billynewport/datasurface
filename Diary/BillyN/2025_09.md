Working on getting it working on AWS today using EKS. Pointed my local kubectl to the EKS cluster and doing the bring using local shells.

Having trouble with far gate. Switching to EC2. Problems are mainly with efs-sc. So far, experience with AWS is poor. It's very slow. Deleting clusters and so on takes over 20 minutes. I don't know if this is normal.
