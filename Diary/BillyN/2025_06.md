I created a new test to introspect DSL classes and check that all attributes are covered by the __eq__ method. This is important because if an attribute is not tested then that attribute can be modified by an unauthorized repository and the git action handler will not catch it. This new test checks that all attributes are covered by the __eq__ method. I did find a few places where the __eq__ method was not complete. I fixed them.
