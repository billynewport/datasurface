I created a new test to introspect DSL classes and check that all attributes are covered by the __eq__ method. This is important because if an attribute is not tested then that attribute can be modified by an unauthorized repository and the git action handler will not catch it. This new test checks that all attributes are covered by the __eq__ method. I did find a few places where the __eq__ method was not complete. I fixed them.

More work on improving testing for the DSL objects and Ecosystem and Team now use the new constructor style. Happy with the testing progress. Need to focus on having a working DataPlatform for rest of week.

I need to revise my credential thinking. As part of getting to MVP for this, this all needs to be fleshed out right now. The DataPlatform owns the Credential store (this will ultimately be the PlatformProvider but for now, the DataPlatform can step in). The Credentials specified in the DSL are basically keys to content man+aged by the CredentialStore which depends on the DataPlatform. For example, I currently have FileSecretCredential which makes no sense because it's possible in a kubernetes environment that credential might be in a file or a environment variable. What matters is the type of credential not how it's stored, thats a CredentialStore/DataPlatform concern. When the DAG is rendered, the question is do all the Credentials in the DSL exist in the CredentialStore, this can only be figured out at runtime by checking the runtime platform hosting the DataPlatform. The MERGE Handler for the DataPlatform needs to be able to check this.
