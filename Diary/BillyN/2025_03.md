The schema reconciler. This is a standard service used by DataPlatforms to make sure the tables and views in a data base match the schemas in the DataSurface model. This would typically be called before an operation to update data in a table. Therefore, it is a service which takes a DataPlatform instance, a credential and the Workspace/Datasetgroup containing the datasets to reconcile. The intention graph has a set of graphs keys by the DataPlatform instance. It also has a list of DSG's per DataContainer. I'm going to try a simply python job using sqlachemy and SQL to start with. This will work and be tested on Postgres and hopefully will work on cloud databases like Snowflake/Redshift also. I'll try to avoid Spark for now.

Worked with claude to start getting a postgres instance running in github actions and locally. Adding a conftest.py file to initialize a fixture for the tests which need postgres accessto run.
