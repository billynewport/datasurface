I have made good progress on componentizing the kubernetes services yaml now in the Yellow PSP. I have 2 YellowDataPlatforms in the yellow starter project. One is LIVE and the other is MILESTONED. They both need a "stack" thats common to host the airflow and merge database. I'd like the ability to change the stack to be outside the YellowDataPlatform instances, 2 database or 2 databases, the namespace, nothing to do with them really. It's the PSP which is the common stack. However, ideally even the PSP I have now is not abstract enough to be a generic kubernetes environment to build the BlueDataPlatform which may be kubernetes based but completely different from Yellow, it might have an different job scheduler, it might run in minio for s3 compatible storage and a SQL database on top of S3. But, I don't want to have to redo all the kubernetes stuff when I need to do this.

Assembly and Component are basically a jinja template assembly framework and not kubernetes specific. I have the different Components for name spaces, postgres, airflow, logging and so on which can be reused. Maybe this is enough?

Working through the ripple on this, it's big. Always a lift...
