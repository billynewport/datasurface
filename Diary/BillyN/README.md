# Diary

This section is a diary of the project intended to capture my thinking over time on how and why I'm doing things in certain ways. This is always going to be a stream of consciousness type of writing so it will reflect changing opinions or even have contradications over time. This is normal and expected. The idea is to capture the thinking at the time and to provide a way to analyze the progression of the project over time and help someone else or an AI to help me if I'm stuck. This is not being edited after the fact or edited for consistency. The best way to consume this is likely by using an LLM to take it and summarize the current findings and surprises over time.
