Worked on making DSL objects more traceable when reporting validation errors. It was just reporting the name of the class and the issue but this doesn't tell the user where to look to find the problem. The code todays records the file and line number which constructed the DSL object, for example DataStore or Dataset etc. It does this by walking back the stack frame when the object is constructed looking for a stack frame which is not part of the datasurface codebase. The ValidationTree code was modified also to force all objects associated with a validation tree to be a LintableObject which is the construct every DSL class now inherits from.

ValidationTree.printTree was modified also to print out className@file:linenumber rather than just className. The next step is once again to finish a local DataPlatform to get a working system end to end.

There are also objects which are constructed from the model after it's been defined. These classes like pipeline graphs and the like inherit from a LintableObject subclass called InternalLintableObject. This simply sets the filename and line number to "Internal:0" and avoids walking the stack for these objects as there is no point. Users don't create these objects in their source, they are created by the system.

Redid the class hierarchy for LintableObjects. Base class is now a ValidatableObject. This is subclasses by UserDSLObject rather than LintableObject. There is also an InternalLintableObject for objects created by the system. This is better but also required moving the ABC base class of quite a few DSL classes to the ValidatableObject class. ABC can't be defined more than once it seems.

Starting on adding in streaming Datastore support.

Making CredentialStore a first class DSL object with it acting as a factory for Credentials. Doing this as I think more about a Kafka streaming IngestionMetadata. I should have done this earlier.
