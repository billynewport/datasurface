I'm working with cursor in auto mode to verify the starter platform is correctly generating the kubernetes and airflow artifacts. It's working suprisingly well. The kubernetes artifacts are working on my local docker desktop kubernetes cluster. I built a docker container image for all the datasurface code which we need for airflow tasks as they are primarily kubernetes pod operators which need a container image. I'm building the image with this command:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.datasurface -t datasurface/datasurface:latest .
```

I have created a repository on docker hub called datasurface and the primary container image is there and called datasurface/datasurface:latest.
