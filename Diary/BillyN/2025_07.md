I'm working with cursor in auto mode to verify the starter platform is correctly generating the kubernetes and airflow artifacts. It's working suprisingly well. The kubernetes artifacts are working on my local docker desktop kubernetes cluster. I built a docker container image for all the datasurface code which we need for airflow tasks as they are primarily kubernetes pod operators which need a container image. I'm building the image with this command:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.datasurface -t datasurface/datasurface:latest .
```

I have created a repository on docker hub called datasurface and the primary container image is there and called datasurface/datasurface:latest.

Right now, the bootstrap infrastructure is working and I wrote a [how to guide](../docs/HowToKubPGStarterSetup.md) for setting up the starter platform. The airflow DAG seems ok and the next step is to render the terraform files for the kafka connectors and the ingestion DAG.

Reworking the SQLIngestion stuff. I'm trying to simplify for the starter platform. The easiest ingestion involves as few moving parts as possible. A simple batch "select * from every table" to staging every batch is easy and useful. There are a lot of databases in companies which simply exist and have no fancy CDC software. A SQL full pull is the answer given how hard it is to reversion these datastores on more modern databases or add CDC to them.

Working on the snapshot merge job. Frustration with SQLAlchemy type checking drove me back to 2.0 but it's still not great. I miss Java at times like this.

Command to build the datasurface container image:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.datasurface -t datasurface/datasurface:latest .
```

Command to push the image to docker hub:

```bash
docker push datasurface/datasurface:latest
```

Looking at docker scout. I don't like all the vulnerablilities so I spent an hour today cleaning up the image, much better now and everything works on python 3.13 so thats good.
