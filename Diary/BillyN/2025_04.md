Initial location: New Zealand.

Spent today working on finishing the json serialization for DataTypes. Created tests to make sure that all the types are serialized correctly. This makes the model server usable when I need it.

Largely using cursor in Agent/auto mode and it's working well. It mostly wrote the model server with some minor fixes. I'm noticing it's more aware of context and this is improving the tabbing. The cursor rules I added are also helping with generation.
