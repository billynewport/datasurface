Initial location: New Zealand.

Spent today working on finishing the json serialization for DataTypes. Created tests to make sure that all the types are serialized correctly. This makes the model server usable when I need it.

Largely using cursor in Agent/auto mode and it's working well. It mostly wrote the model server with some minor fixes. I'm noticing it's more aware of context and this is improving the tabbing. The cursor rules I added are also helping with generation.

Working yesterday on security. Security and DataPlatform are independent components. We'll need an extensible framework for SecurityModules. We can provide a default implementation which works with the ZeroDataPlatform and postgres but would serve as a model for writing other SecurityModules.

I'm just about to get on a flight to Sydney from Queenstown. The next 2 weeks will be in Sydney for hopefully, I can get ZeroDataPlatform up and working. I need a better name than ZeroDataPlatform. This Zero doesn't work with Security, ZeroSecurityModule doesn't work for some reason...

Maybe, just rename ZeroDataPlatform to PostgresDataPlatform or SimpleDataPlatform.

The kafka CDC ingestion class needs to support mappings. It needs to allow a data producer to specify how the datasets in their datastore are exported to the Kafka topics and what the expected format is. Really, it's the other way around though. The DataPlatform will support the mappings defined in the ingestion classes. The producer must publish their data to the topics in a way that the supported mappings can be used.

For Kafka, debezium would be a standard mapping. Insert and update messages on a topic per dataset is also an option.
