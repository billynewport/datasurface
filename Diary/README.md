# Diary

This is a diary of the project intended to capture thinking over the life of the project. It's divided in to people and then year and month.

I'm doing this to capture my thinking over time and this helps when using a local LLM or Git Copilot to analyze whats happening and provide ideas. Without this temporal status updates capturing the progression, it's hard for an LLM to understand whats been tried, why it didn't work and to suggest better options. I document issues that are happening, what I've tried and what I'm thinking about trying next. This is a way to capture the progression of the project and to provide a way to analyze the progression of the project over time and help someone else or an AI to help me if I'm stuck.

All contributors should keep a diary and document it here for the benefit of others and LLMs.
