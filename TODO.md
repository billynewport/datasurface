## Purchased 128GB 8 core x86 box for docker/proxmox

Purchased for $1200 on May 8th.

### Switch Windows to Proxmox

Plan is to use proxmox as the hypervisor for the box. I will be added Docker containers for the following images:

* Microsoft SQL Server
* Debezium for CDC
* LocalStack for S3 emulation
* pypi local server
* GitLab CI/DC Git server
* Runner for GitLab builds 
* Kubernetes for running spark jobs
* Hadoop cluster with Hive/Spark Runners
