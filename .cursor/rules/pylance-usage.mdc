# Your rule content

- Please make sure all python code uses full pylance type annotations, I want maximal compile time type checking
- Please use the typing module when appropriate
- Blank lines must not contain spaces, they should just be an empty line
- Lines must not have trailing spaces
- I use flake to lint the code also so all code should be generated to have zero flake errors
- My maximum line length is set to 170 characters so please split lines so they are under 170 characters
- All the documentation is stored in the docs folder as markdown files.
- There is a developer diary showing their thinking and decisions in Diary/BillyN, there are monthly markdown files updated constantly.
- I always use classes for my pytest test cases and I use unittest for my testing framework. I name the test classes with a prefix of Test
- There should be one empty line at the end of every file.
