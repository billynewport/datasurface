# Running tests on Windows

In order to run these tests on a Windows 11 machine, you need to download the winutils from githab, define a HADOOP_HOME env variable pointing at it and add HADOOP_HOME/bin to your PATH.

## Download Winutil

I did a git clone from here https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils

I set HADOOP_HOME to the 2.8.3 folder within that repository

I added %HADOOP_HOME%\bin to my user PATH variable on the end.
