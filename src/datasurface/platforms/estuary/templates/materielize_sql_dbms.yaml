        # 3: Provide resource configuration for the binding between the Flow
        #    collection and the endpoint resource. This connector interfaces
        #    with a SQL database and its resources are database tables. Here,
        #    we provide a table to create and materialize which is bound to the
        #    `acmeCo/products/anvils` source collection.
        resource:
          table: anvil_products

      # Multiple resources can be configured through a single connector.
      # Bind additional collections to tables as part of this connector instance:
      - source: acmeCo/products/TNT
        resource:
          table: tnt_products

      - source: acmeCo/customers
        resource:
          table: customers
