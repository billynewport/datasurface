# YellowDataPlatform: A Modern, Kubernetes-Native Data Platform

*How DataSurface's flagship data platform revolutionizes enterprise data ingestion with PostgreSQL, Airflow, and intelligent orchestration*

## Introduction: The Enterprise Data Pipeline Problem

Enterprise data teams face a brutal reality: **data pipelines are a nightmare**. Traditional approaches create point-to-point connections resulting in **P × C pipelines** (producers × consumers), leading to combinatorial maintenance overhead, vendor lock-in, and data teams drowning in infrastructure instead of creating value.

Enter **DataSurface** - a revolutionary data ecosystem broker that transforms this chaos into manageable simplicity. **YellowDataPlatform** represents the first implementation in the DataSurface ecosystem - a pragmatic, lightweight solution designed specifically for small to medium enterprises that need powerful data capabilities without enterprise-scale complexity.

## What is DataSurface?

Before diving into YellowDataPlatform, it's essential to understand the broader vision. DataSurface redefines Infrastructure as Code (IaC) into **"Intention as Code"** (IaC 2.0). Instead of building complex pipelines, enterprise actors simply express their data intentions:

- **Data Producers** declare what data they generate
- **Data Consumers** specify what data they need and how they want it
- **Data Transformers** define derivative data creation
- **Data Platform owners** create platform products to satisfy these needs

The **DataSurface Broker** then arbitrates between consumer intentions and available data platforms, automatically selecting the best platform for each use case and generating the necessary data flow graphs.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Ecosystem Model"
        DP[Data Producers] -->|Contribute| EM(Ecosystem Model)
        DC[Data Consumers] -->|Contribute| EM
        DT[Data Transformers] -->|Contribute| EM
    end

    subgraph "DataSurface Broker"
        EM -->|Interprets| DS[DataSurface]
    end

    subgraph "YellowDataPlatform"
        DS -->|Maps to| IG1[Intention Graph]
        IG1 -->|Realized by| YDP[YellowDataPlatform]
    end
```

This approach reduces pipeline complexity from **P × C** to **P + C + T**, eliminating vendor lock-in and allowing teams to focus on value creation rather than infrastructure plumbing.

## YellowDataPlatform: The First DataPlatform Implementation

YellowDataPlatform serves as DataSurface's initial implementation - a production-ready, Kubernetes-native data platform designed for small to medium enterprises. It proves the ecosystem broker concept works while maintaining operational simplicity and cost-effectiveness.

### Design Philosophy

YellowDataPlatform embodies a **"start simple, scale smart"** philosophy tailored for small to medium enterprises:

- **SQL-First Architecture**: Betting on SQL's 40+ year proven track record rather than complex distributed systems
- **PostgreSQL as Foundation**: Leveraging PostgreSQL's proven reliability and surprising scalability for most enterprise workloads
- **Kubernetes-Native**: Built for modern cloud environments while maintaining operational simplicity
- **Pragmatic Scaling**: Easy to start with, transparent evolution path as organizations grow

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

YellowDataPlatform consists of four primary technical components:

#### 1. **Kubernetes Container Orchestration**
- Complete container lifecycle management
- Automatic scaling and resource management
- Service discovery and networking
- Persistent volume management for data storage

#### 2. **Apache Airflow Job Scheduling**
- Leverages Airflow's dynamic DAG generation for flexible ingestion stream management
- PostgreSQL-backed DAG configuration stored in `platform_airflow_dsg` table
- Kubernetes Pod Operators for executing DataSurface jobs
- Standard Airflow scheduling and monitoring capabilities

#### 3. **PostgreSQL Data Storage**
- **Staging Tables**: Raw ingested data with batch metadata
- **Merge Tables**: Clean, queryable data for consumers
- **Workspace Views**: Consumer-specific data access with proper permissions
- High-performance indexing for both staging and merge operations

#### 4. **Kafka Connect Integration**
- Seamless ingestion from SQL databases
- Change Data Capture (CDC) support via Debezium
- Topic-to-staging table streaming
- Configurable through Terraform providers

### Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Sources"
        SQL[(SQL Databases)]
        KAFKA[Kafka Topics]
    end

    subgraph "Yellow Data Platform"
        KC[Kafka Connect] --> ST[Staging Tables]
        SQL --> ST
        ST --> |Merge Jobs| MT[Merge Tables]
        MT --> |Views| WV[Workspace Views]
    end

    subgraph "Consumers"
        WV --> APP1[Application 1]
        WV --> APP2[Application 2]
        WV --> APP3[Application N...]
    end

    subgraph "Orchestration"
        AF[Airflow Scheduler] --> |Triggers| KC
        AF --> |Executes| ST
        AF --> |Manages| MT
    end
```

## How YellowDataPlatform Works

### 1. **Data Ingestion Process**

YellowDataPlatform supports multiple ingestion patterns:

#### **Batch Snapshot Ingestion**
```python
# Simplified example of the ingestion flow
class SnapshotMergeJobLiveOnly(Job):
    def executeBatch(self, sourceEngine: Engine, mergeEngine: Engine, key: str) -> JobStatus:
        # 1. Create new batch ID
        batchId = self.createNewBatch(mergeEngine, key)
        
        # 2. Ingest data to staging with hashing
        self.ingestNextBatchToStaging(sourceEngine, mergeEngine, key, batchId)
        
        # 3. Merge staging to production tables
        self.mergeStagingToMerge(mergeEngine, batchId, key)
        
        # 4. Create/update workspace views
        self.createViews(mergeEngine, key, batchId)
```

Each ingested record gets augmented with:
- **Batch ID**: Tracking identifier for processing runs
- **Key Hash**: MD5 hash of primary key columns
- **All Hash**: MD5 hash of all columns for change detection

#### **Real-time CDC Ingestion**
Kafka Connect with Debezium captures database changes in real-time, streaming them to staging tables where merge jobs process them incrementally.

### 2. **Staging Tables: The Ingestion Layer**

Staging tables serve as the platform's ingestion buffer:

```sql
-- Example staging table structure
CREATE TABLE staging_customers (
    -- Original columns
    customer_id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    
    -- DataSurface metadata columns
    ds_surf_batch_id INTEGER,
    ds_surf_key_hash VARCHAR(32),   -- Hash of primary key
    ds_surf_all_hash VARCHAR(32)    -- Hash of all columns
);
```

**Key Features:**
- Schema evolution support with automatic table alterations
- Performance indexes on hash columns for efficient merging
- Batch-based processing for data lineage tracking
- Internal platform tables (not exposed to consumers)

### 3. **Merge Tables: The Production Layer**

Merge tables contain the final, queryable data. YellowDataPlatform supports two merge strategies:

#### **Live-Only Merge** (Default)
- Single current record per entity
- High-performance upserts using PostgreSQL's `INSERT...ON CONFLICT`
- Automatic deletion of records no longer in source

```sql
-- Live-only merge operation (simplified)
INSERT INTO merge_customers 
SELECT *, batch_id, key_hash, all_hash 
FROM staging_customers 
WHERE batch_id = $1
ON CONFLICT (key_hash) 
DO UPDATE SET 
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    email = EXCLUDED.email,
    all_hash = EXCLUDED.all_hash
WHERE merge_customers.all_hash != EXCLUDED.all_hash;
```

#### **Forensic/Milestoned Merge**
- Complete historical record preservation
- `batch_in` and `batch_out` columns track record lifecycles
- Point-in-time querying capabilities
- Compliance and audit trail support

### 4. **Workspace Views: The Consumer Interface**

Consumers never directly access staging or merge tables. Instead, YellowDataPlatform creates workspace-specific views:

```sql
-- Example workspace view
CREATE VIEW workspace_analytics_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, name, email, ds_surf_batch_id
FROM merge_customers
WHERE ds_surf_batch_out = -1;  -- Only current records

-- Grant permissions only to workspace users
GRANT SELECT ON workspace_analytics_customers TO analytics_team;
```

This approach provides:
- **Security isolation**: Each workspace sees only authorized data
- **Schema abstraction**: Views can hide platform metadata
- **Flexible data presentation**: Custom transformations per consumer
- **Permission management**: Fine-grained access control

## Job Orchestration and Management

YellowDataPlatform leverages Airflow's dynamic DAG generation capabilities to manage ingestion streams efficiently. Rather than maintaining static DAG files for each data source, the platform uses Airflow's standard dynamic DAG functionality with database-driven configuration stored in the `platform_airflow_dsg` table. This approach provides configuration-driven DAG creation and reduces operational overhead.

## Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

YellowDataPlatform is designed as a cloud-native application with sophisticated Kubernetes orchestration:

### Infrastructure Components

```yaml
# Core services deployed via generated kubernetes_services.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: yellow-platform

---
# PostgreSQL with persistent storage
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:15
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: "yellowplatform"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: postgres-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data

---
# Airflow Scheduler with DAG sync
apiVersion: apps/v1  
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: airflow-scheduler
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: airflow-scheduler
        image: apache/airflow:2.8.1
        command: ["airflow", "scheduler"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: git-repo
          mountPath: /opt/datasurface/model
```

### Job Execution Model

Each data processing job runs as a Kubernetes Job:

```yaml
# Generated for each ingestion stream
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: platform-model-merge-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: model-merge-handler
        image: datasurface/datasurface:latest
        command: ["/bin/bash"]
        args:
        - -c
        - |
          # Clone model repository
          git clone {{ git_repo_url }} /workspace/model
          cd /workspace/model && git checkout {{ git_repo_branch }}
          
          # Execute merge job
          python -m datasurface.cmd.platform executeJob \
            --model /workspace/model \
            --platform {{ platform_name }} \
            --store {{ store_name }}
```

This approach provides:
- **Resource Isolation**: Each job gets dedicated compute resources
- **Fault Tolerance**: Job failures don't affect the platform
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes automatically schedules across nodes
- **Security**: Jobs run with minimal required permissions

## Performance and Scalability Considerations

### PostgreSQL as the Foundation

YellowDataPlatform's choice of PostgreSQL as the primary storage engine is deliberate and strategic:

**Scalability Reality Check:**
- Modern PostgreSQL instances can scale to **32 vCores with 128GB RAM**
- AWS RDS supports instances up to **192 vCores with 768GB RAM**
- **The fastest distributed database is a single-node database large enough for the workload**
- Distribution has costs; single-node systems outperform distributed systems up to a significant threshold

**Performance Optimizations:**
```sql
-- Staging table indexes for merge performance
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_batch_id ON staging_table(ds_surf_batch_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_key_hash ON staging_table(ds_surf_key_hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_staging_all_hash ON staging_table(ds_surf_all_hash);

-- Merge table indexes for query performance  
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_merge_key_hash ON merge_table(ds_surf_key_hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_merge_batch_id ON merge_table(ds_surf_batch_id);
```

### Airflow Scaling Limitations and Solutions

**Current Limitations:**
- Airflow effectively supports ~500 DAGs maximum
- Each ingestion stream creates one DAG
- Suitable for most enterprise use cases

**Future Evolution Path:**
- DataSurface's architecture enables transparent platform migration
- When better platforms emerge, consumers automatically benefit
- No re-engineering required for consumer applications

## Schema Evolution and Data Integrity

YellowDataPlatform includes sophisticated schema management:

### Automatic Schema Evolution
```python
def reconcileStagingTableSchemas(self, mergeEngine: Engine, store: Datastore, cmd: SQLSnapshotIngestion) -> None:
    """Ensure staging tables match current source schemas"""
    for dataset in store.datasets.values():
        tableName = self.getStagingTableNameForDataset(dataset)
        stagingTable = self.getStagingSchemaForDataset(dataset, tableName)
        
        # Automatically alter table to match current schema
        createOrUpdateTable(mergeEngine, stagingTable)
        
        # Maintain performance indexes
        self.createStagingTableIndexes(mergeEngine, tableName)
```

### Change Detection and Validation
- **Hash-based change detection** prevents unnecessary processing
- **Schema fingerprinting** detects source structure changes  
- **Batch state management** ensures consistency across processing runs
- **Rollback capabilities** via the `resetBatchState` method

## Security and Governance Integration

YellowDataPlatform implements enterprise-grade security:

### Credential Management
```python
# Kubernetes-native credential storage
class KubernetesEnvVarsCredentialStore(CredentialStore):
    def getAsUserPassword(self, credential: Credential) -> tuple[str, str]:
        # Secure credential retrieval from Kubernetes secrets
        return self._readFromSecret(credential.name)
```

### Access Control
- **Workspace isolation**: Views provide data boundary enforcement
- **Role-based permissions**: Fine-grained access control per workspace
- **Audit trails**: Complete data lineage tracking
- **Encryption support**: Both client-side and server-side encryption

### Governance Policy Enforcement
DataSurface's governance zones can constrain:
- Which data containers can store specific data classifications
- Encryption requirements for sensitive data
- Geographic data residency requirements
- Compliance policy enforcement

## The Future: Columnar Evolution Path

While PostgreSQL provides an excellent foundation, YellowDataPlatform's architecture anticipates evolution:

### Current SQL-First Strategy
```mermaid
graph LR
    YP[YellowDataPlatform<br/>PostgreSQL] --> SF[Snowflake Platform]
    YP --> AT[Athena Platform] 
    YP --> AZ[Azure SQL Platform]
    SF --> |Transparent Migration| C[Consumers]
    AT --> |Transparent Migration| C
    AZ --> |Transparent Migration| C
```

### Planned Evolution
1. **Portable SQL Layer**: Common abstraction across SQL engines
2. **Columnar Platform Implementations**: Snowflake, Athena, Azure SQL variants
3. **Transparent Consumer Migration**: Zero consumer code changes
4. **Performance Optimization**: Automatic platform selection based on workload

This approach ensures:
- **Future-proofing**: Technology evolution without consumer disruption
- **Cost optimization**: Right-sized platforms for specific workloads  
- **Performance benefits**: Latest columnar storage advantages automatically
