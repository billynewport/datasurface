- Ensure proper foreign key relationships between customer and address tables
- Update the test ecosystem in `eco.py` to reflect this new schema
- Maintain data classifications for all personally identifiable information

#### Task 1.2: Create Dual DataPlatform Configuration

**Description:** Implement two separate YellowDataPlatform instances to support both live and forensic processing requirements as specified in your MVP.

**Details:**
